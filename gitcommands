ï»¿VERSION CONTROLLING:
Process of preserving the diff versions of code.

GIT:
It is a software

GITHUB:
Centralised repo(data modifications through git.

BIT BUCKET IS ALSO SAME.

# git init                                             ------> it is used to initilize the git repository
# git config --global user.name "user_name"            ------> it is used to set the user name 															   
# git config --global user.email "user_mail_id>	 	   ------> it is used to set the user mail_id
# git config --list 


# touch                                                ------> it is used to create a empty files
# vi 							------> create files

WORKING REPO TO STAGGING
------------------------
Working directory is the folder where the developer is creating his code

Stagging area is the intermediate buffer zone
where the files are initially placed.The files present in stagging area are called tracked files

	 												   
# git add <file_name>                                  ------> it is used to send the file from workspace to stagging area
                                                               (note--> at a time will send only one file)
# git add <file_name_1> <file_name_2>....<file_name_n> ------> it is used to send the file from workspace to stagging area
                                                               (note--> at a time will send multiple files)
# git add .                                            ------> it is used to send the files from workspace to status area(note--> at a time send all files)

STAGGING TO WORKING REPO
------------------------
# git reset head <file_name>                           ------> it is used to fetch the files from stagging area to workspace area.
# git reset head filename 				-----> take back from stagging to working repo.

MODIFIED FILE:
-------------
# Using vi editor -- edit the committed file --then shows in stagging area as modified file not a untracked file
# git commit -am "new message" 

# git status                                           ------> it is used to display the detail status about our work like how many files are 
                                                               in untracted area,stagging area..etc
                                   			------> it displays list of users
STAGGING TO LOCAL REPO:
----------------------


# git commit -m "commit_name"                          ------> it is used to send the files from stagging area to Local repository
                                                               (note--> at a time will send all files under singal commit_name)
# git commit -m "commit_name" <file_name>              ------> it is used to send the files from stagging area to Local repository(note--> at a time will send only one files)	
# git commit -m "commit_name" <file_name_1> <file_name_2> file_name_n> ----> it is used to send the files from stagging area to Local repository
# git show <commit_id>                                 ------> it will generate the files under commit, i.e that particular commit_id how many files are present.
# git log -2 or # git log -n 2                         ------> it will show latest two commits only
# git log -4 or # git log -n 4                         ------> it will show latest four commits only
# git log -1 --oneline or # git log -n 1 --oneline     ------> it will show latest one commits only	but single like formate.
# git log --author=<author_name>                       ------> it will display author commit messages {if we do any collobaration for example santhosh sai krishore working on same git repo ..if we apply this command it shows authors who are working on this git repo.}

# git log --since=yyyy-mm-dd                           ------> the logs will display since from 25th july to 27   
  ex--> # git log --since=2018-07-25
# git log --until=yyyy-mm-dd                           ------> the logs will display since from 25th july to 27   
  ex--> # git log --until=2018-07-25                   ------> the logs will display since from 25th july to till date
# git log                                              ------> it is used to see the commit status like list of commits
                                                               (it includes auothe name & autoher mail id ...etc)
# git log --oneline                                    ------> it is also to see the commit list but it will show single line formate
 

LOCAL REPO TO STAGGING :
------------------------

# git reset --soft <commit_id>                         ------> it is used to fetch the files from local repository to stagging area .{ you cant pull back the first commit]
                                                               (note--> take the before commit_id i.e 2nd commit_id from starting onwords)

LOCAL REPO TO WORKING AREA:
---------------------------
# git reset --mixed <commit_id>                        ------> it is used to fetch the files from local repository to workspace area 
                                                               (note--> take the before commit_id i.e 2nd commit_id from starting onwords)
TO CHANGE THE COMMIT NAME AND ID:
---------------------------------
# git commit --amend -m "new name"			------> to change the latest commit name only 

TO CHANGE THE OLDEST COMMIT:
---------------------------
At the time of cration repo seleect the readme. file then it shows as first commit with the help readme. file's commit we can alter the first commit.



BRANCHING:
---------
# git branch <branch_name>                             ------> it is used to create a new branch
# git checkout <branch_name>                           ------> to move into a branch
# git checkout -b <branch_name>                        ------> to create a branch and move into it
# git branch                                           ------> it is used to display list of branches
# git branch -a                                        ------> to see the list of all branchs(local as well as remote repository)

To MERGE THE BRANCH
-------------------
# git merge <branch_name>                              ------> it is used to merge the files from one branch to another branch

WITHOUT MERGING THE BRANCH PUSHING INTO GIT HUB(CENTRALIZED REPO)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
# git push <path of repository> <child branch_name>    ------> it is used to send the files from child branch to remote repository

TO DELETE THE BRANCH IN GITHUB
------------------------------
# git push origin -d <branch_name>                     ------> it is used to delete the branch which are available in remote repository

TO DELETE THE BRANCH IN LOCAL REPO
----------------------------------
# git branch -d <branch_name>                          ------> it is used to delete the branch in local repository( this is soft delete)
# git branch -D <branch_name>                          ------> it is used to delete the branch in local repository( this is hard delete)

REBASE:
------
FAST FORWARD MERGING --CREATING A LINEAR COMMIT HISTORY
# git rebase master
# git merge branchname
                                 
TO RESOLVE THE COLFLICTS FOR DEVLOPERS WHILE MERGING THE BRANCHES:
------------------------------------------------------------------

Two different branches master,child are both have same file and try to merge the child with master.
in two way it can be solve (auto merging conflict and manual colflict)
shows a conflict and which file has problem too (i.e MASTER|MERGING BRANCH),devops enigeer will report to concern developer team
to delete the file content.
To skip this 
git merge --abort -----------> skip the issue temperarly.
 
COLLABRATION ISSUE:
------------------
GO top setting -- collabrations -- by user id -- get email notification

ONE REPO BATCH24 -- collabrated with new developer --new dev clone the url if batch24 
--so now old devloper and old commit and push their codes -- who did 1st commit will have no problem
-- who did second push thier problem -- bocz repo geets changed by 1st push 
-- so who got error need to again clone url or
--- by pull the batch24 url repo.

DEVOPS ENGINEER NEED TO CREATE ACCES FOR NEW DEVELOPER:
DEVOPS ENGINEER NEED TO CREATE THE CENTRALIZED REPO:

ALIAS FOR COMMANDS
------------------
Frequently used command make it as short cut.
# git config --global alias.<any_ane> "log --oneline"  ------> it is used to set a alias name instead of giving "log --oneline" i can give simple "alias_name"
 UNSET THE ALIAS COMMAND:
DELETe the previous github credentials also in pc.
# git config --global --unset alias.<alias_name> or user.name or user.email      ------> it is used to remove the alias name

TO CHECK THE ONE DEVELOPER(AUTHOR) COMMITS:
------------------------------------------
# git log --author=authorname


STASH 
------
this is command help you to (temorarily  but saftly) store  your uncommited local changes 
(i.e only stagging area files)
# git stash list                                       ------> this command will show the list of stash files
# git stash save "<stash_name">                        ------> it is used to save the files in stash memory from stagging area
# git stash pop                                        ------> it is used to move the files from stash memory to stagging area only last updated file(like cut and paste)
# git stash pop stash@{number}		                   ------> it is used to move the files from stash memory to stagging area(note--> that particular stash id file only)
# git stash apply 		                               ------> it is used to move the files from stash memory to stagging area only last updated file(like copy and paste)
# git stash show -p stash@{number}                     ------> it will show the list of files available in stash memory id 
# git stash drop                                       ------> it is used to delete the stash file(note--> only updated  file)
# git stash drop stash@{number}                        ------> it is used to delete the stash file but only particular stash_id

TAGS
----------
Tag operation allows giving meaningful names o a specific version in the repository.

# git tag                                              ------> it is used to display list of tag names
# git tag <tag_name>                                   ------> it is used to set a tag name for commits
# git show <tag_name>                                  ------> it will display files from under tag_name
# git push origin <tag_name>                           ------> it is used to send the tag names into git repository(note--> by defaulty master branch)
# git push origin <branch_name> <tag_name>             ------> it is used to send the tag names into git repository(note--> that particular branch)
# git tag -d <tag_name>                                ------> it is used to delete the tag name in local repository
# git push origin -d <tag_name>                        ------> it is used to delete the tag name in remote repository
# git push origin -d <branch_name>                     ------> it is used to delete the branch in remote repository
# git tag <tag_name> <commit_id>                       ------> it is used to create tag in that particular commit_id

OTHER COMMANDS:
--------------

# git log --decorate --oneline                         ------> it displays branch's level information i.e branch level codes. {

# git reset head <file_name>                           ------> it is used to fetch the files from stagging area to workspace area.

# conflict file(issue)                                 ------> two different branchs with same file_name and different information(we are trying to merging than it will show a 
                                                               error like conflict file issue(by using manual merging we can solve this not in automated))

Web server: serves content to the web using http protocol.

Application server: hosts and exposes business logic and processes.

I think that the main point is that the web server exposes everything through the http protocol,
 while the application server is not restricted to it.

That said, in many scenarios you will find that the web server is being 
used to create the front-end of the application server, that is, it exposes a set 
of web pages that allow the user to interact with the business rules found into the application server.



git merge apply all unique commits from branch A into branch B in one commit with final result
git merge doesnât rewrite commit history, just adds one new commit
git rebase gets all unique commits from both branches and applies them one by one
git rebase rewrites commit history but doesnât create extra commit for merging
